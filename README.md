Sisi game
=========

This is a game made with python and tkinter. To run it, run gui.py using python 3.

This game allows the player to battle the current leader of Egypt (Sisi). It functions similar to a pokemon battle, with each side taking turns using different attacks and moves to try to defeat the opponent. Each move has associated power and accuracy. The player battles 10 incarnations of Sisi, with each one more powerful than the previous one.

- Game now restarts when completed, and can easily be exited at any time through the menu
- Easter egg included if the user does not input a name for themself
