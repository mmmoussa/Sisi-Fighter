Sisi Fighter
=========

This is a game made with python 3 and Tkinter, and then converted into OSX and Windows applications using py2app and py2exe.

This game allows the player to battle the current leader of Egypt (Sisi). It functions similar to a pokemon battle, with each side taking turns using different attacks and moves to try to defeat the opponent. Each move has associated power and accuracy. The player battles 10 incarnations of Sisi, with each one more powerful than the previous one.

####Features:
- Game has a full GUI. All game functions and requirements exist inside this.
- Game can now easily be restarted or exited at any time through the menu.
- Move memory; the game will remember your last-used move and make it the default for your current attack, allowing for the game to be sped up if the player wants to continuously use the same move.
- Easter egg included if the user does not input a name for themself.
